								My educational, professional, and personal experiences have revolved around technology. The potential of cutting-edge technology is exploding and impacting billions of lives. I want to be part of shaping that. 
								<br><br>
								To that end, my educational, professional, and personal experiences have also revolved around people. A new technology won't make an impact in a company unless it's presented well to the people who make decisions. A new technology won't fix problems unless you work with a client to elicit requirements, and a user understands its design.
								<br><br>
								For technology to truly make an impact, one must understand both technology and people. With my career, I aim to do just that.
								<br><br>
								I promise the image is just a placeholder. I'll take another when I get a haircut, seriously.

										From January to August 2017, I worked at Bosch's <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bosch-presse.de/pressportal/de/en/bosch-officially-opens-new-research-campus-in-renningen-42977.html">Research Campus</a> near Stuttgart, Germany. I spent a most of that time <em>designing and developing a research software suite</em> for sensor data aggregation and analysis, implemented with <em><a target="_blank" href="https://www.influxdata.com/time-series-platform/influxdb/">InfluxDB</a>, node.js, and modern web technologies.</em> This suite was built ground-up to be modular and user-friendly; it had to be useful to as many different types of researchers with as many different types of sensors as possible. I also assisted in building experimental sensor platforms in <em>Altium</em> for PCB design and layout, and <em>Solidworks</em> for 3D-printing of PCB enclosures.

									<p>
										Through this time, I was able to further my professional competencies and contribute to Bosch's research through communicating with researchers and eliciting their requirements, and seeing these requirements through to finished applications, all while learning the requisite web technologies. Above all, though, I had the opportunity to <em>live and learn and work in German</em> with people from around the world.

										From January&ndash;April and September&ndash;December of 2015, I worked at the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bmwusfactory.com/manufacturing/building-a-better-bmw/information-technology-research-center/">Information Technology Research Center</a>, near the BMW Manufacturing plant in Greenville, South Carolina. There, I assisted my department in investigating applications of emerging technologies in manufacturing. The department's main focus during my time there was <em>Deep Learning</em>.
									</p>
									<div class="keywords">Deep Learning</div>
									<p>
										To that end, I worked with automobile inspectors to develop and deploy an <em>iOS application that saved each inspector over an hour a day</em>, while providing us with training data for models. Upon completion, the application was presented to the BMW Board of Directors. I autonomously scheduled meetings with managers and inspectors to elicit requirements and give updates, conducted training, acquired and deployed hardware, and supported the application in production.
									</p>
									<div class="keywords">iOS application that saved each inspector over an hour a day</div>
									<p>
										Before this, I also supported the development and coordinated training and trials for an experimental <em><a target="_blank" href="http://www.bmwblog.com/2014/11/19/bmw-visual-inspection-memory-function-via-google-glass/">Google Glass application</a></em> that assissted in automobile inspections, and supported <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jul/04/bmw-3d-prints-new-thumbs-for-factory-workers">a research project</a> which would help line workers who were suffering from repetative strain injury with <em>3D-printed customized braces</em>. Between major projects, I explored T<em>building 3D environments</em>, used for inspections or virtual tours, with photographs taken by quadcopters and a custom-built Raspberry-Pi-based <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballbot">ballbot</a>. Alongside this, I prepared large training datasets with <em>Shell and Python</em>.

									<div class="keywords">Shell and Python</div>
									<p>
										With all of these concurrent projects over the course of 8 months, I also had significant experience in managing my time and utilizing my resources to meet parallel demands. Furthermore, all of the technologies I encountered in my time at BMW were new to me, and I demonstrated that I was capable of quick learning, and that I was able to apply my existing skills to new fields.

										In Summer 2016, I took the opportunity to explore research in an academic context. I worked with <a target="_blank" href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mUujTIcAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao">Dr. Rashmi Jha</a> in the <a target="_blank" href="http://eecs.ceas.uc.edu/MIND">MIND Laboratory</a>, developing and exploring <em>neuromorphic hardware </em>based on ReRAM technology. In my 10 weeks there, I learned about semiconductor fabrication and neuromorphic methods for implementing machine learning in hardware. I contributed to the research conducted in the lab by developing a <em>MATLAB simulation workbench </em>for testing various parameters in relevant learning models.

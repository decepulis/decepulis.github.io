										From January to August 2017, I worked at Bosch's <a target="_blank" rel="nooopener" href="http://www.bosch-presse.de/pressportal/de/en/bosch-officially-opens-new-research-campus-in-renningen-42977.html">Research Campus</a> near Stuttgart, Germany. I spent a most of that time <em>designing and developing a research software suite</em> for sensor data aggregation and analysis, implemented with <em><a target="_blank" rel="nooopener" href="https://www.influxdata.com/time-series-platform/influxdb/">InfluxDB</a>, node.js, and modern web technologies.</em> (I <i>love</i> sensors!) I was detail-obsessed as I built the suite ground-up to be modular and user-friendly; it had to be useful to as many different types of researchers with as many different types of sensors as possible. I also assisted in building experimental sensor platforms in <em>Altium</em> for PCB design and layout, and <em>Solidworks</em> for 3D-printing of PCB enclosures.

										Through this time, I was able to further my professional competencies and contribute to Bosch's research through communicating with researchers&mdash;eliciting their requirements, and seeing these requirements through to finished applications (all while learning the requisite web technologies). Above all, though, I had the opportunity to <em>live and learn and work in German</em> with people from around the world.

										 January&ndash;April and September&ndash;December of 2015, I worked at the <a target="_blank" rel="nooopener" href="https://www.bmwusfactory.com/manufacturing/building-a-better-bmw/information-technology-research-center/">Information Technology Research Center</a>, near the BMW Manufacturing plant, in Greenville, South Carolina. There, I assisted my department's effort to investigate applications of emerging technologies in manufacturing. The department's main focus during my time there was <em>Big Data</em>.
									</p>
									<div class="keywords">Big Data</div>
									<p>
										To that end, I worked with automobile inspectors to develop and deploy an <em>iOS application that saved each inspector over an hour a day</em>, while providing us with training data for models. Upon completion, the application was presented to the BMW Board of Directors. I autonomously scheduled meetings with managers and inspectors to elicit requirements and give updates, designed the application to meet the requirements of the inspectors and my department, conducted training, acquired and deployed hardware, and supported the application in production.
									</p>
									<div class="keywords">iOS app that saved users 1+ hours/day</div>
									<p>
										Before this, I also supported the development and coordinated training and trials for an experimental <em><a target="_blank" rel="nooopener" href="http://www.bmwblog.com/2014/11/19/bmw-visual-inspection-memory-function-via-google-glass/">Google Glass application</a></em> that assisted in automobile inspections, and supported <a target="_blank" rel="nooopener" href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jul/04/bmw-3d-prints-new-thumbs-for-factory-workers">a research project</a> which would help line workers who were suffering from repetitive strain injury with <em>3D-printed customized braces</em>. Between major projects, I explored <em>building 3D environments</em>, used for inspections or virtual tours, with photographs taken by quadcopters and a custom-built Raspberry-Pi-based <a target="_blank" rel="nooopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballbot">ballbot</a>. Alongside this, I prepared large training datasets with <em>Shell and Python</em>.

										With all of these concurrent projects over the course of eight months, I also had significant experience in managing my time and utilizing my resources to meet parallel demands. Furthermore, all of the technologies I encountered in my time at BMW were new to me, and I demonstrated that I was capable of quick learning, and that I was able to apply my existing skills to new fields.

										In Summer 2016, I took the opportunity to explore research in an academic context. I worked with <a target="_blank" rel="nooopener" href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mUujTIcAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao">Dr. Rashmi Jha</a> in the <a target="_blank" rel="nooopener" href="http://eecs.ceas.uc.edu/MIND">MIND Laboratory</a>, developing and exploring <em>neuromorphic hardware </em>based on <a target="_blank" rel="nooopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistive_random-access_memory">ReRAM</a> technology. In my ten weeks there, I learned about semiconductor fabrication and neuromorphic methods for implementing machine learning in hardware. I contributed to the research conducted in the lab by developing a <em>MATLAB simulation workbench </em>for testing various parameters in relevant learning models.

										I'll be honest: I'm new to Keras and TensorFlow, having only taken a pair of Lynda courses, and I might be biting off more than I can chew.

So I've downloaded the <a target="_blank" rel="nooopener" href="http://cvrr.ucsd.edu/LISA/lisa-traffic-sign-dataset.html">LISA Traffic Sign Dataset</a> and I'm going to train a model on it.

										Hobby Electronics: my comfort zone. Arduinos and Raspberry Pis have always been my favorite toys at home. And then, ever since buying a set of Philips Hue lights, I've been trying to automate <emph>everything</emph> by hooking it up to Apple's <a target="_blank" rel="nooopener" href="https://www.apple.com/ios/home/">HomeKit</a> smart home control system. Finally, as anyone who has ever lived with me can attest, I have a thing about lighting. I will spend a whole afternoon trying to get the right color, intensity, and accent lighting in a room. This leads me to this project: an <a target="_blank" rel="nooopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP8266">ESP8266</a>-controlled RGB light strip.
										<br><br>
										The motive of this project, besides having another fun and cool light source, was to get to know the ESP8266, which promises to enable extremely inexpensive homemade smart home appliances. And "inexpensive" is a key word here! Inspired by <a target="_blank" rel="nooopener" href="https://randomnerdtutorials.com/10-diy-wifi-rgb-led-mood-light-with-esp8266-step-by-step/">another project</a>, I assembled my BOM mostly from eBay for about $20:

										After remembering how transistors work and assembling and testing the circuit with some simple <a target="_blank" rel="nooopener" href="https://github.com/decepulis/SMD5050-Homebridge/blob/master/experiments/RGB5050_local/RGB5050_local.ino">offline Arduino code</a>, the time came to connect the circuit to HomeKit... Luckily, there was no need to re-invent the wheel on this one, as it had been done before. (I'm not claiming this is novel work!)

And, I even found a <a target="_blank" rel="nooopener" href="https://www.esp8266.com/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=12259">great guide</a> which provided both functioning Arduino code to run on the ESP8266, and configuration for a homebridge module. Finally, I went ahead and <a target="_blank" rel="nooopener" href="https://github.com/decepulis/SMD5050-Homebridge/blob/master/SMD5050-Homebridge.ino">rewrote the Arduino Code</a> so that switching between colors would have a nice transition, and made some changes to the <a target="_blank" rel="nooopener" href="https://github.com/decepulis/SMD5050-Homebridge/blob/master/config.json">config.json</a> in order to work with the latest version of the homebridge module.

Success.

										<b>Creating Socio-Technical Patches for Information Foraging: A Requirements Traceability Case Study</b>
										<label for="project-thesis-check" class="project-modal-close">&times;</label>
									</div>
									<div class="project-modal-body">
										In my thesis, I explored applications of <a target="_blank" rel="nooopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_foraging">Information Foraging Theory</a>. We hunt for information in the exact same way that we've evolved to hunt for food. How long do we spend in one place before we move on? How do we estimate how much food that place will have? If we understand that human behavior better, maybe we can make the Software Engineering process better. Can we make developing more efficient by making good information easier to reach, identify, and navigate? 
										<br><br>
										Within information foraging theory, I'm currently focusing on foraging in socio-technical environments. It's hard to answer questions in environments that have both information artifacts and people; one must consider both the relationships between information and the relationships between people when seeking answers. For example: let's say I just saw the movie Interstellar and I'm looking for more moves I'd like. We could recommend Gravity, or Star Wars, or The Martian, too. But despite being sci-fi, they're all quite different movies. What happens, though, if we add a human element? Christopher Nolan directed Interstellar. That connects me to The Dark Knight and Dunkirk&mdash;now different genres, but still movies I loved for the craft and scale that Christopher Nolan brings. By adding a human element to our graph, among other elements to make it heterogeneous, we suddenly have more nuanced information foraging.
										<br><br>
										With the indispensible guidance of my advisor, and quite a few late nights, I was able to submit the core work of my thesis to IEEE's Visual Languages and Human-Centric Computing Conference (VL/HCC) in April of 2018, four months after beginning work. Incredibly, it was <a target="_blank" rel="nooopener" href="http://vlhcc18.github.io/accepted_papers.html">accepted</a>! I had an incredible experience <a target="_blank" rel="nooopener" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BoaEUbPH8Zv/?taken-by=dardarb1nks">traveling</a> <a target="_blank" rel="nooopener" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BofZdvKnExe/?taken-by=dardarb1nks">to</a> <a target="_blank" rel="nooopener" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BoeQUDAH_uS/?taken-by=dardarb1nks">Lisbon</a>, and presenting my work to the conference, while learning about the world of Visual Languages and Human-Centric Computing. When the proceedings show up online, I'll link to them here.
										<br><br>
										Image: The work which formed my thesis consistedof two parts: creating graphs from socio-technical environments, and assigning weights to each node in the graph (where a weight represents a node's relevance to a user's question in that environment). You can see one of these networks here, where the intensity of red in each node represents its weight.

										Maybe I should have gone into Psychology, for Human Factors. Don't get me wrong&mdash;I <i>love</i> problem solving with computers. But figuring out human problems is just as fun to me as building an app or gizmo. I first had an inkling of this when I had the wonderful challenge of designing UI/UX for non-technical users of my app. How do they think the app should work, and what visual cues could I provide, incorporating those expectations, so that the user could accomplish their tasks? In Human-Robot Interaction, I had a semester of an in-depth look at how people think, and how we should design robots around those thoughts. 
										<br><br>
										In this class's final project, we were tasked with designing a Human-Robot interaction study, to test how humans react to some element within robotics. To substantially lighten physical, monetary, and safety concerns, we decided to conduct a trial in Virtual Reality. Within a VR environment, programmed in Unity, we had our subjects pass a ball to a humanoid robot arm and a non-humanoid robot arm. We were testing to see if the appearance of the robot would affect the passing task (with the hypothesis that our subjects would more-confidently pass the ball to the humanoid robot). 
										<br><br>
										How did it go? Well, not that well. At the end of the semester, there were only so many underclassmen who weren't furiously studying for exams that we could conscript for our test. With a sample size of 16, we didn't have the statistical power to say anything for certain. Aside from that, our <a target="_blank" rel="nooopener" href="http://www.bartneck.de/publications/2009/measurementInstrumentsRobots/">Godspeed Questionnaire</a> indicated that perhaps the difference between our humanoid and non-humanoid models wasn't good enough. Is it something we could publish? Heck no. But I learned so much about conducting a human trials, and indeed, Human-Robot Interaction.

										Tic Talk: A Time Management App
										<br><br>
										The problem was this: my roommate and I took a long time to learn time management through college and in our years of bad time management we lost sleep and we cut corners on assignments. As we got better at managing our time, so too did the quality of our lives increase. How could we, Computer Engineering students, create something for our Capstone Senior Design project, that could help others do the same?
										<br><br>
										We spent fall semester planning. With our advisor's guidance, we conducted interviews with our target audience (Engineering College Students) to elicit requirements, and worked hard to decide how to turn those requirements into features. In the end, we decided that we needed an application that would 
											<li>allow users to input their upcoming assignments and schedule them as desired</li>
											<li>suggest how long an assignment might take based on history and user estimation</li>
											<li>automatically schedule a week</li>
											<li>integrate with Google Calendar</li>
											<li>be cross-platform</li>
											<li>be easy-to-use (to satisfy my recent UI/UX obsessions)</li>
											<li>engage with the user to encourage good practices (without being an annoying Clippy)</li>
										<br>
										Then, came spring semester. <i>Oh</i> how quickly that deadline came up on us. Overwhelmed with our other classes, we had trouble dedicating the time we needed to polish this application. Frankly, we could have used our own app. But despite that, we managed to constantly adapt our plan to changing circumstances and to have a working prototype at the Senior Design Expo. And here it is:

										</div>
										<br>
										It wasn't without bugs, but we still found things to be proud of. The Google Calendar integration had a surprising number of hurdles that were overcome. The interview process was extraordinarily insightful, and deeply developed our skills in developing requirements. We managed to meet our stakeholders' requirements with a clever paradigm that encouraged users to schedule work in reasonable blocks, ahead of time, and to still get plenty of sleep. We learned from Material Design and the Apple Human Interface Guidelines and developed an intuitive design language and interaction paradigm. And finally, the project itself managed to be one last lesson in programming Time Management.

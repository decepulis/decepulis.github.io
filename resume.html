										From January to August 2017, I worked at Bosch's <a target="_blank" rel="nooopener" href="http://www.bosch-presse.de/pressportal/de/en/bosch-officially-opens-new-research-campus-in-renningen-42977.html">Research Campus</a> near Stuttgart, Germany. I spent a most of that time <em>designing and developing a research software suite</em> for sensor data aggregation and analysis, implemented with <em><a target="_blank" rel="nooopener" href="https://www.influxdata.com/time-series-platform/influxdb/">InfluxDB</a>, node.js, and modern web technologies.</em> (I <i>love</i> sensors!) I was detail-obsessed as I built the suite ground-up to be modular and user-friendly; it had to be useful to as many different types of researchers with as many different types of sensors as possible. I also assisted in building experimental sensor platforms in <em>Altium</em> for PCB design and layout, and <em>Solidworks</em> for 3D-printing of PCB enclosures.

Above all, though, I had the opportunity to <em>live and learn and work in German</em> with people from around the world.

										 January&ndash;April and September&ndash;December of 2015, I worked at the <a target="_blank" rel="nooopener" href="https://www.bmwusfactory.com/manufacturing/building-a-better-bmw/information-technology-research-center/">Information Technology Research Center</a>, near the BMW Manufacturing plant, in Greenville, South Carolina. There, I assisted my department's effort to investigate applications of emerging technologies in manufacturing. The department's main focus during my time there was <em>Big Data</em>.
									</p>
									<div class="keywords">Big Data</div>
									<p>
										To that end, I worked with automobile inspectors to develop and deploy an <em>iOS application that saved each inspector over an hour a day</em>, while providing us with training data for models. Upon completion, the application was presented to the BMW Board of Directors. I autonomously scheduled meetings with managers and inspectors to elicit requirements and give updates, designed the application to meet the requirements of the inspectors and my department, conducted training, acquired and deployed hardware, and supported the application in production.
									</p>
									<div class="keywords">iOS app that saved users 1+ hours/day</div>
									<p>
										Before this, I also supported the development and coordinated training and trials for an experimental <em><a target="_blank" rel="nooopener" href="http://www.bmwblog.com/2014/11/19/bmw-visual-inspection-memory-function-via-google-glass/">Google Glass application</a></em> that assisted in automobile inspections, and supported <a target="_blank" rel="nooopener" href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jul/04/bmw-3d-prints-new-thumbs-for-factory-workers">a research project</a> which would help line workers who were suffering from repetitive strain injury with <em>3D-printed customized braces</em>. Between major projects, I explored <em>building 3D environments</em>, used for inspections or virtual tours, with photographs taken by quadcopters and a custom-built Raspberry-Pi-based <a target="_blank" rel="nooopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballbot">ballbot</a>. Alongside this, I prepared large training datasets with <em>Shell and Python</em>.

									<p>
										With all of these concurrent projects over the course of eight months, I also had significant experience in managing my time and utilizing my resources to meet parallel demands. Furthermore, all of the technologies I encountered in my time at BMW were new to me, and I demonstrated that I was capable of quick learning, and that I was able to apply my existing skills to new fields.

A couple dozen hours later, here I am typing this lil interactive &lt;div&gt; element! I've been applying my experience from my web app writing at Bosch towards writing this page, and like with most coding projects, I've spent a fair amount of time on Stack Overflow figuring out how to do what I want to do.

										<b>Thesis: Information Foraging Theory in Heterogeneous Graphs</b>
										<label for="project-thesis-check" class="project-modal-close">&times;</label>
									</div>
									<div class="project-modal-body">
										In my ongoing thesis (estimated completion, July 2018), I am exploring <a target="_blank" rel="nooopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_foraging">Information Foraging Theory</a>. We hunt for information in the exact same way that we've evolved to hunt for food. How long do we spend in one place before we move on? How do we estimate how much food that place will have? If we understand that human behavior better, maybe we can make the Software Engineering process better. Can we make developing more efficient by making good information easier to reach, identify, and navigate? 
										<br><br>
										Within information foraging theory, I'm currently focusing on foraging in heterogeneous networks. Let me put that in English, though. Let's say I just saw the movie Interstellar and I'm looking for more moves I'd like. Well, how do we search for movies? We could recommend Gravity because they're both modern sci-fi movies (genre). We could recommend Star Wars, or The Martian, too. But despite being sci-fi, they're all quite different movies. What happens, though, if we add a human element? Christopher Nolan directed Interstellar. That connects me to The Dark Knight and Dunkirk&mdash;now different genres, but still movies I loved for the craft and scale that Christopher Nolan brings. By adding a human element to our graph, among other elements to make it heterogeneous, we suddenly have more nuanced information foraging. 
										<br><br>
										I'm oversimplifying, of course. And there's a lot of other elements of foraging that I'm exploring. But we can get into that later. Hopefully soon I'll have a thesis, and maybe some other research, that I can link to here.

										Maybe I should have gone into Psychology, for Human Factors. Don't get me wrong&mdash;I <i>love</i> problem solving with computers. But figuring out human problems is just as fun to me as building an app or gizmo. I first had an inkling of this when I had the wonderful challenge of designing UI/UX for non-technical users of my app. How do they think the app should work, and what visual cues could I provide, incorporating those expectations, so that the user could accomplish their tasks? In Human-Robot Interaction, I had a semester of an in-depth look at how people think, and how we should design robots around those thoughts. 
										<br><br>
										Currently, we're wrapping up our class project. We were tasked with designing a Human-Robot interaction study, to test how humans react to some element within robotics. To substantially lighten physical, monetary, and safety concerns, we decided to conduct a trial in Virtual Reality. Within a VR environment, programmed in Unity, we had our subjects pass a ball to a humanoid robot arm and a non-humanoid robot arm. We were testing to see if the appearance of the robot would affect the passing task (with the hypothesis that our subjects would more-confidently pass the ball to the humanoid robot). 
										<br><br>
										How did it go? Well, not that well. At the end of the semester, there were only so many underclassmen who weren't furiously studying for exams that we could conscript for our test. With a sample size of 16, we didn't have the statistical power to say anything for certain. Aside from that, our <a target="_blank" rel="nooopener" href="http://www.bartneck.de/publications/2009/measurementInstrumentsRobots/">Godspeed Questionnaire</a> indicated that perhaps the difference between our humanoid and non-humanoid models wasn't good enough. Is it something we could publish? Heck no. But I learned so much about conducting a human trials, and indeed, Human-Robot Interaction.

										Tic Talk: A Time Management App
										<br><br>
										The problem was this: my roommate and I took a long time to learn time management through college and in our years of bad time management we lost sleep and we cut corners on assignments. As we got better at managing our time, so too did the quality of our lives increase. How could we, Computer Engineering students, create something for our Capstone Senior Design project, that could help others do the same?
										<br><br>
										We spent fall semester planning. With our advisor's guidance, we conducted interviews with our target audience (Engineering College Students) to elicit requirements, and worked hard to decide how to turn those requirements into features. In the end, we decided that we needed an application that would 
											<li>allow users to input their upcoming assignments and schedule them as desired</li>
											<li>suggest how long an assignment might take based on history and user estimation</li>
											<li>automatically schedule a week</li>
											<li>integrate with Google Calendar</li>
											<li>be cross-platform</li>
											<li>be easy-to-use (to satisfy my recent UI/UX obsessions)</li>
											<li>engage with the user to encourage good practices (without being an annoying Clippy)</li>
										<br>
										Then, came spring semester. <i>Oh</i> how quickly that deadline came up on us. Overwhelmed with our other classes, we had trouble dedicating the time we needed to polish this application. Frankly, we could have used our own app. But despite that, we managed to constantly adapt our plan to changing circumstances and to have a working prototype at the Senior Design Expo. And here it is:

										</div>
										<br>
										It wasn't without bugs, but we still found things to be proud of. The Google Calendar integration had a surprising number of hurdles that were overcome. The interview process was extraordinarily insightful, and deeply developed our skills in developing requirements. We managed to meet our stakeholders' requirements with a clever paradigm that encouraged users to schedule work in reasonable blocks, ahead of time, and to still get plenty of sleep. We learned from Material Design and the Apple Human Interface Guidelines and developed an intuitive design language and interaction paradigm. And finally, the project itself managed to be one last lesson in programming Time Management.

										"Anything?"<br>"Yes, as long as you gain experience with Embedded Systems."<br>Such was the directive that launched our Embedded Systems project, which set out to automatically make coffee using a <i>real</i> brew method (we chose pour-over) and to wake a user up. Controlled by Arduino, the hand-stained wooden programmable digital clock will boil water, pour into a wire-mesh pour over, and ring a large call bell with a servo until you press the big "OFF" button.

										Inspired by an <a target="_blank" rel="nooopener" href="http://quantifiedselfie.us">awesome project</a> I saw online, I decided in 2015 to analyze six years of Facebook messages and SMS in order to not only practice data analytics in Python, but also to gain interesting insights on my relationships. The project involved scrubbing HTML, storing data in useful data structures, and manipulating and plotting the data using NumPy and Bokeh in Python.

										I thought I'd solved the yearly struggle of coming up with an individualized thoughtful Christmas present for everyone in the family pretty nicely in 2015! For my Lithuanian family, I made clocks, based off of individually-addressable LEDs (I have an obsession with lighting) driven by an Arduino, which spell out the time in plain English&mdash;er&mdash;Lithuanian. "It is 12 'o clock".

									<li>All Engineering Students at University of Cincinnati are required to take two semesters of Engineering Models&mdash;an introduction to programming (in MATLAB). The concepts taught in this class are useful for all majors, not only because programming is a cross-disciplinary tool, but also because learning programming encourages the kind of critical thinking that's necessary to breaking down Engineering problems. As a TA for this class, I've worked with students from diverse backgrounds as they begin their journey in Engineering, working with them in two hour weekly labs to understand the challenge of the week, or to understand the fundamentals of programming. No matter what, the eight hours a week I spent as a TA in lab have been bright ones.</li>

									<li>In my high school and early university summers, I returned to my childhood summer camps as a camp counselor. There, I cared for a group of 8-14 year old kids and planned educational and engaging programs. As I became a senior counselor, I was put in charge of larger programs, often working with or leading groups of counselors for a successful day or evening. I could not fill my summers with enough of this challenging and gratifying job.</li>

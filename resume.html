	Hi! Thanks for stopping by my source code! 
	I'm in the process of teaching myself web technologies. 
	If you see anything you'd improve, please let me know.

								My educational, professional, and personal experiences have revolved around technology. The potential of cutting-edge technology is exploding and impacting billions of lives. I want to be part of shaping that. What's possible?
								<br><br>
								To that end, my educational, professional, and personal experiences have also revolved around people. A new technology won't make an impact in a company unless it's presented well to the people who make decisions. A new technology won't fix problems unless you work with a client to elicit requirements, and a user understands its design.
								<br><br>
								For technology to truly make an impact, one must understand both technology and people. With my career, I aim to do just that.
								<br><br>
								I promise the image is just a placeholder. I'll take another when I get a haircut, seriously.

I spent a most of that time designing and developing <em>a research software suite for sensor data aggregation and analysis</em>. This suite, based on <em>node.js, InfluxDB, and modern web technologies,</em> was built ground-up to be modular and user-friendly; it had to be useful to as many different types of researchers with as many different types of sensors as possible. I also assisted in building experimental sensor platforms in <em>Altium</em> for PCB design and layout, and <em>Solidworks</em> for 3D-printing of PCB enclosures. Above all, though, I had the opportunity to <em>live and learn and work in German</em> with people from around the world.</li>

									From January&ndash;April and September&ndash;December of 2015, I worked at the <a href="https://www.bmwusfactory.com/manufacturing/building-a-better-bmw/information-technology-research-center/">Information Technology Research Center</a>, near the BMW Manufacturing plant in Greenville, South Carolina. There, I assisted my department in investigating applications of emerging technologies in manufacturing. The department's main focus during my time there was <em>Deep Learning</em>.
									<br><br>
									To that end, I worked with automobile inspectors to develop and deploy an <em>iOS application that saved each inspector over an hour a day</em>, while providing us with training data for models. Upon completion, the application was presented to the BMW Board of Directors. I autonomously scheduled meetings with managers and inspectors to elicit requirements and give updates, conducted training, acquired and deployed hardware, and supported the application in production.
									<br><br>
									Before this, I also supported the development and coordinated training and trials for <a href="http://www.bmwblog.com/2014/11/19/bmw-visual-inspection-memory-function-via-google-glass/"><em>a Google Glass application</em></a> that assissted in automobile inspections, and supported <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jul/04/bmw-3d-prints-new-thumbs-for-factory-workers">a research project</a> which would help line workers who were suffering from repetative strain injury with <em>3D-printed customized braces</em>. Between major projects, I explored <em>building 3D environments</em>, used for inspections or virtual tours, with photographs taken by quadcopters and a custom-built Raspberry-Pi-based <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballbot">ballbot</a>. Alongside this, I prepared large training datasets with <em>Shell and Python</em>.

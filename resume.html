										From January to August 2017, I worked at Bosch's <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bosch-presse.de/pressportal/de/en/bosch-officially-opens-new-research-campus-in-renningen-42977.html">Research Campus</a> near Stuttgart, Germany. I spent a most of that time <em>designing and developing a research software suite</em> for sensor data aggregation and analysis, implemented with <em><a target="_blank" href="https://www.influxdata.com/time-series-platform/influxdb/">InfluxDB</a>, node.js, and modern web technologies.</em> I was detail-obsessed as I built the suite ground-up to be modular and user-friendly; it had to be useful to as many different types of researchers with as many different types of sensors as possible. I also assisted in building experimental sensor platforms in <em>Altium</em> for PCB design and layout, and <em>Solidworks</em> for 3D-printing of PCB enclosures.

									<p>
										Through this time, I was able to further my professional competencies and contribute to Bosch's research through communicating with researchers&mdash;eliciting their requirements, and seeing these requirements through to finished applications (all while learning the requisite web technologies). Above all, though, I had the opportunity to <em>live and learn and work in German</em> with people from around the world.

										 January&ndash;April and September&ndash;December of 2015, I worked at the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bmwusfactory.com/manufacturing/building-a-better-bmw/information-technology-research-center/">Information Technology Research Center</a>, near the BMW Manufacturing plant, in Greenville, South Carolina. There, I assisted my department's effort to investigate applications of emerging technologies in manufacturing. The department's main focus during my time there was <em>Deep Learning</em>.
									</p>
									<div class="keywords">Deep Learning</div>
									<p>
										To that end, I worked with automobile inspectors to develop and deploy an <em>iOS application that saved each inspector over an hour a day</em>, while providing us with training data for models. Upon completion, the application was presented to the BMW Board of Directors. I autonomously scheduled meetings with managers and inspectors to elicit requirements and give updates, designed the application to meet the requiremnts of the inspectors and my department, conducted training, acquired and deployed hardware, and supported the application in production.
									</p>
									<div class="keywords">iOS application that saved users over an hour a day</div>
									<p>
										Before this, I also supported the development and coordinated training and trials for an experimental <em><a target="_blank" href="http://www.bmwblog.com/2014/11/19/bmw-visual-inspection-memory-function-via-google-glass/">Google Glass application</a></em> that assissted in automobile inspections, and supported <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jul/04/bmw-3d-prints-new-thumbs-for-factory-workers">a research project</a> which would help line workers who were suffering from repetative strain injury with <em>3D-printed customized braces</em>. Between major projects, I explored <em>building 3D environments</em>, used for inspections or virtual tours, with photographs taken by quadcopters and a custom-built Raspberry-Pi-based <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballbot">ballbot</a>. Alongside this, I prepared large training datasets with <em>Shell and Python</em>.

									<p>
										With all of these concurrent projects over the course of eight months, I also had significant experience in managing my time and utilizing my resources to meet parallel demands. Furthermore, all of the technologies I encountered in my time at BMW were new to me, and I demonstrated that I was capable of quick learning, and that I was able to apply my existing skills to new fields.

										In Summer 2016, I took the opportunity to explore research in an academic context. I worked with <a target="_blank" href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mUujTIcAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao">Dr. Rashmi Jha</a> in the <a target="_blank" href="http://eecs.ceas.uc.edu/MIND">MIND Laboratory</a>, developing and exploring <em>neuromorphic hardware </em>based on <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistive_random-access_memory">ReRAM</a> technology. In my ten weeks there, I learned about semiconductor fabrication and neuromorphic methods for implementing machine learning in hardware. I contributed to the research conducted in the lab by developing a <em>MATLAB simulation workbench </em>for testing various parameters in relevant learning models.

A couple dozen hours later, here I am typing this lil interactive &lt;div&gt; element! I've been applying my experience from my web app writing at Bosch towards writing this page, and like with most coding projects, I've spent a fair amount of time on Stack Overflow figuring out how to do what I want to do. I've spent an incredible amount of time making sure the site will work without JavaScript (brought to you by checkboxes and CSS3...) and on all form factors.

										In my ongoing thesis (estimated completion, July 2018), I am exploring <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_foraging">Information Foraging Theory</a>. We hunt for information in the exact same way that we've evolved to hunt for food. How long do we spend in one place before we move on? How do we estimate how much food that place will have? If we understand that human behavior better, maybe we can make the Software Engineering process better. Can we make developing more efficient by making good information easier to reach, identify, and navigate? Especially for end users&mdash;not full-time programmers&mdash;this is a particularly relevant question. Keep your eye on this space for more details as progress progresses.

Over the course of my last two undergraduate semesters, we've been following a design process to write an application that will somehow alleviate student stress. After identifying student stress as the issue we wanted to solve (new technology is useless if it doesn't make an existing problem somehow better), we narrowed our scope to enhancing users' time management skills. Better time management skills mean lower stress. We've conducted a series of interviews and developed an architecture. This semester, we face developing, testing, and presenting.

									<li>All Engineering Students at University of Cincinnati are required to take two semesters of Engineering Models&mdash;an introduction to breaking down questions into engineering problems and solving them with MATLAB. As a TA for this class, I've worked with students from diverse backgrounds as they begin their journey in Engineering, working with them in two hour weekly labs to understand the challenge of the week, or to understand the fundamentals of programming. No matter what, the eight hours a week I spent as a TA in lab were always bright ones.</li>

									<li>In my high school and early university summers, I returned to my childhood summer camps as a camp counselor. There, I cared for a group of 8-14 year old kids and planned educational and engaging programs. As I became a senior counselor, I was put in charge of larger programs, often working with or leading groups of counselors for a successful day or evening. I could not fill my summers with enough of this challenging and gratifying job.</li>
